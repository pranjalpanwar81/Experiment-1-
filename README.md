# CDS-120-Exp-1

Aim -> (A) To print hello world command. <br>
       (B) To make a calculator. <br>

Theory ->  C++ is a high level object-oriented programming language. It is also known as "C with class".<br> 
           It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. <br>
           It  implements all the OOPs concepts. <br>
           It is a compiled language. <br>
           (A) To print an output in C++ we use cout command. <br>
               Syntax: cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print; <br> 
           (B) Basic arithematic operations like addition, subtravtion, multiplication and division can be performed. <br> 
               To take input from the user, we use "cin" command. <br>
               Syntax: cin>>value_to_be_entered;  <br>
               
Output <br>

(A) <br>

(B) <br> 
![exp2](https://github.com/Shloka-Patel/Experiment---1/blob/main/Output_1B.png)

Conclusion -> In this experiment, I learnt about C++ programming lnguage, its basic commands and also made a program for calculator.  <br>
