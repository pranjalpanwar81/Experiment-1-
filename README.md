# Downloading and installing VS Code, (Hello World and Calculator Program).

Aim -> Downloading and isntalling VS Code, (Hello World and Calculator Program).

Software -> Visual Studio Code

Theory -> C++ is a high level object-oriented programming language. It is also known as "C with class".
It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.<br>
It implements all the OOPs concepts.<br>
It is a compiled language.<br>
(A) To print an output in C++ we use cout command.<br>
Syntax: cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print;<br>
(B) Basic arithematic operations like addition, subtravtion, multiplication and division can be performed.
To take input from the user, we use "cin" command.<br>
Syntax: cin>>value_to_be_entered;<br>
